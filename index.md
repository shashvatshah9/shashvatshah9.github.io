  <li>
    <b> Benchmarking and Training image classification model Resnet-18 on varying compute configurations </b> <br/>
    Developed a modified Resnet-18 using PyTorch without Batch Normalization layers, and trained it on the
    CIFAR10 dataset. The training was done using different machines on the NYU Greene super compute with
    different numbers of CPU and GPU cores, and also fine-tuning hyperparameters like the number of
    Dataloader workers and optimizers.

  <li>
    <b> Multi-Lingual Review Classification and Inference using Transformers </b> <br/>
    Developed and deployed a text classification model using Hugging Face Transformers, using a multi-lingual
    text dataset containing real-life product reviews from Amazon.com. The model was deployed on the Hugging
    face model hub and later utilized for inference
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Secure Chat Application</b> <br/>
    Developed an Andriod chat application with GCP Firebase backend. This application supported single and group
    conversations, with real time firebase message delivery. This application was a lite application which could be easily
    integrated into other android applications.

    <b>Cognitive Computing ‚Äì Idea Labs, Nirma University</b> <br/>
     Created a system that calibrated brain waves from an EEG headset to determine the recall ability of a person while
    performing a forced choice memory test on flags images. The recall of images was predicted on time series data using
    LSTM RNN. The precision of this classifier of this one of a kind test was around 0.7.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Adaptive Video Player </b> <br/>
    Developed a web application that recognized student behavior while studying from video lectures. Data is streamed from
    an EEG headset, eye position from a camera (using OpenCV), and heart rate from a sensor to NoSQL database. And,
    Based on this data, an algorithm was designed to calibrate the student‚Äôs attention level and using javascript the playback
    speed of the web video player was adapted.
