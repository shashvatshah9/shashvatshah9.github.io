    <b> Multi-Lingual Review Classification and Inference using Transformers </b> <br/>
    Developed and deployed a text classification model using Hugging Face Transformers, using a multi-lingual
    text dataset containing real-life product reviews from Amazon.com. The model was deployed on the Hugging
    face model hub and later utilized for inference

    <b>Secure Chat Application</b> <br/>
    Developed an Andriod chat application with GCP Firebase backend. This application supported single and group
    conversations, with real time firebase message delivery. This application was a lite application which could be easily
    integrated into other android applications.

  <b>Adaptive Video Player </b> <br/>
    Developed a web application that recognized student behavior while studying from video lectures. Data is streamed from
    an EEG headset, eye position from a camera (using OpenCV), and heart rate from a sensor to NoSQL database. And,
    Based on this data, an algorithm was designed to calibrate the student‚Äôs attention level and using javascript the playback
    speed of the web video player was adapted.
